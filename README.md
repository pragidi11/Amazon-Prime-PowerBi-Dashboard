# Prime Video Subscription Analysis

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes subscription data for Prime Video users. It contains various attributes such as total active users, auto-renewal percentage, subscription duration, feedback ratings, payment methods, and user demographics. Additionally, the dataset provides insights into usage frequency by purchase category, subscription plans, and the distribution of monthly vs. annual users. This data helps in understanding customer behavior, payment preferences, and engagement levels.

## Description of the Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard presents an in-depth analysis of Prime Video subscription trends. The total number of active users is 2500, with an auto-renewal percentage of 50.96%, indicating a relatively balanced mix of recurring and new subscriptions. The average feedback score is 4.00, suggesting a generally positive user experience. Subscription duration is standardized at 365 days, indicating an annual subscription model.

Payment method preferences show that Mastercard is the most popular (856 users), followed by Visa (838 users) and Amex (806 users). Usage frequency by purchase category reveals that books have the highest engagement (851 users), followed closely by electronics (847 users), while clothing purchases have the lowest engagement (802 users). The total monthly and annual user distribution is almost equal, with 50.84% opting for annual subscriptions and 49.16% for monthly plans. Gender-based analysis shows a balanced distribution across different genres, with slight variations in preferences for action, horror, romance, and comedy content.

## Conclusion 

The analysis indicates that Prime Video has a strong user base, with a high percentage of recurring subscribers. However, there is potential to increase auto-renewal rates through targeted retention strategies such as personalized offers, exclusive content, and improved engagement. The equal distribution of monthly and annual users suggests the need for flexible pricing models to accommodate different user preferences. Additionally, Mastercard is the preferred payment method, but efforts could be made to incentivize alternative payment options for better accessibility. The lower engagement in clothing-related purchases compared to books and electronics suggests a need for improved promotional strategies in this category. By implementing these recommendations, Prime Video can enhance user retention, optimize its subscription model, and improve overall customer satisfaction.
